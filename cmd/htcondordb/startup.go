// Startup phase timing.
//
// Startup logs a line when the daemon begins and another when the command socket is up, with
// everything in between silent. A slow start therefore shows only as a gap between two
// timestamps -- enough to notice ("suspiciously close to exactly 10s") and not enough to act on,
// because the gap covers reading security config, building the authorization policy, opening the
// database, and adopting the listener, any of which could own it.
//
// This records each phase and logs the breakdown, so the next slow start names the culprit
// instead of prompting an investigation.

// slowPhase is the per-phase duration above which a phase is called out on its own line rather
// than only appearing in the summary. Opening a database over a large spool legitimately takes a
// while; a second spent reading config files does not.
